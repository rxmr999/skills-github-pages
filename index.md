# üçª **Strong Beer Tasting - This Saturday -  11/16 - 2PM** üçª

- I have a lot of strong beers, like barrel-aged stouts, barley wines, and quads.
  
- They should be consumed. Drinking outside is best.
  
- Beers like this are made to share, so come sit outside and sample some strong beers.

- Feel free to bring any of your own. Or don't. 

- I'll have a TV with football on, and probably some chili or something to eat too.

- Please invite anyone you like as long as they expect nothing more than some beer. This is not fancy.
  
- Families welcome. Anyone welcome. Apologies for the lack of diversity in the drawing. Blame DALLE.

**1716 Ridgeway Drive**



**No RSVP needed. Show up when and if you like.**

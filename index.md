# 🍻 **Strong Beer Tasting** 🍻

I have a lot of strong beers that should be consumed, like barrel-aged stouts, barley wines, and quads. Beers like this are made to share, so come sit outside and sip some beers.

Feel free to bring any of your own if you want to. 

I'll have a TV with football on, and probably some chili or something to eat too. 

Please invite anyone you like — It's only sitting outside, sampling beer, and watching football.

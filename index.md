# 🍻 **Strong Beer Tasting - This Saturday -  11/16 - 2PM** 🍻

- I have a lot of strong beers, like barrel-aged stouts, barley wines, and quads, that should be consumed.
  
- Beers like this are made to share, so come sit outside and sip some beers.

- Feel free to bring any of your own. 

- I'll have a TV with football on, and probably some chili or something to eat too.
  
- Kids are welcome. Thomas has somewhere to be but Elena will be here.

- Please invite anyone you like — sitting outside, sampling beer, and watching football.

**1716 Ridgeway Drive**



**No RSVP needed. Show up when and if you like.**
